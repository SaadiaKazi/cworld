        <h4>Tips on how to look after your cactus</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Here are some general guidelines on how to care for your cactus (source: Wikipedia).
            <br>Please also refer to the specific instructions provided with the plant.</p>

            <div class="col-8">
                <h2>Growing Medium</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the growing medium is to provide support and to store water, oxygen and dissolved minerals to feed the plant. For cacti, an open medium with high air content is important. When grown in a container, the general recommendation is that the growing medium contains 25–75% organic-based material, with the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit.</p>

            <div class="col-8">
                <h2>Watering</h2>
                <p>Semi-desert cacti need careful watering. The frequency of watering required will depend on where the cacti are being grown, the nature of the growing medium, and the original habitat of the cacti. More cacti are lost through over-watering than under-watering, but it must be remembered that they need some water during winter too. If you live in a hard water area, regular re-potting is recommended to avoid the build-up of salts. In general, during the growing season, cacti should be allowed to dry out between thorough waterings.</p>

            <div class="col-8">
                <h2>Light & Temperature</h2>
                <p>In summer, semi-desert cacti kept in a greenhouse may be subjected to higher levels of light and temperatures and so the temperature should not be allowed to rise above 32 °C. The minimum winter temperature required depends very much on the species of cactus involved. For a mixed collection, a minimum temperature of between 5 °C and 10 °C is often suggested, except for cold-sensitive genera such as Melocactus and Discocactus.</p>

            <div class="col-8">
                <h2>Propagation</h2>
                <p>Cacti can be grown using seeds, cuttings or grafting. Seeds should be sown in a moist growing medium and keep them in a covered environment until 7–10 days after germination to avoid drying out. The growing medium should not be very wet because it can cause both seeds and seedlings to rot. A temperature range of 18–30 °C is suggested for germination, with soil temperatures of around 22 °C ideal for best root growth. Low light levels are sufficient during germination, but afterwards semi-desert cacti need higher light levels to produce strong growth.</p>

                <h2>Pest Control</h2>
                <p>A range of pests attack cacti in cultivation to feed on sap or eat the plants, living on both stems and roots. Some of these pests are resistant to many insecticides, although there are biological controls available. Over-watering makes cacti more prone to attack by fungi, bacteria and viruses, and fungicides are of limited or no value in combating them.</p>
